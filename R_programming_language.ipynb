        "## Overview\n",
        "R is a popular language and environment that allows powerful and fast manipulation of data, offering many statistical and graphical options.\n",
        "\n",
        "This course aims to introduce R as a tool for statistics and graphics, with the main aim being to become comfortable with the R environment. It will focus on entering and manipulating data in R and producing simple graphs. A few functions for basic statistics will be briefly introduced, but statistical functions will not be covered in detail. The example of a variant call format (vcf) file is used throughout to illustrate the immediate application to medical genetics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Audience\n",
        "This course is aimed at students or early researchers beginning to use statistics and data visualisation in their studies/research who wish to learn more about the R programming language. No prior knowledge of R is required, but undergraduate level knowledge of genetics would be useful.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is R?\n",
        "The official R project web page describes R as a ' language and environment for statistical computing and graphics'. It can be daunting if you haven't done any programming before but it is worth taking some time to familiarise yourself with the R environment as once you have grasped some of the basics it can be a very useful tool.  A wide variety of statistical functions come with the default install and there are many other packages that can be installed if required. \n",
        "\n",
        "It is very quick and easy to produce graphs with default parameters for a quick view of your data and there are all manner of parameters that can be specified to customise your graphs. R is often used to perform analysis and produce graphs for publication.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Good things about R\n",
        "*   It's free\n",
        "*   It works on all platforms\n",
        "*   It can deal with much larger datasets than Excel for example\n",
        "*   Graphs can be produced to your own specification\n",
        "*   It can be used to perform powerful statistical analysis\n",
        "*   It is well supported and documented\n",
        "\n",
        "### Bad things about R\n",
        "*   It can struggle to cope with extremely large datasets\n",
        "*   The environment can be daunting if you don't have any programming experience \n",
        "*   It has a rather unhelpful name when it comes to googling problems (though you can use http://www.rseek.org/ or google ‘R help forum’ and try that instead).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data in VCF format\n",
        "This course will make use of data in the appearance of a variant call format (VCF) file that will be familiar to students and researchers in clinical bioinformatics. If this data format is unfamiliar to you please complete the \"[Understanding variant call format](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/human-genetic-variation-introduction/variant-identification-and-analysis/understanding-vcf-format/)\" tutorial from EBI"
